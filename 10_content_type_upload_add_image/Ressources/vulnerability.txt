CONTENT TYPE UPLOAD - ADD IMAGE

I first tried to upload a php file but it didnt work.
I then tried to upload a png file which didnt work either.
So I went for a jpeg file and in this case it worked.
I then checked the POST requests in my browser.
The only difference was the content-type so I used curl to reproduce the jpeg request but using a php file:
	curl -X POST -v -F "MAX_FILE_SIZE=100000" -F "uploaded=@reverse_shell.php;type=image/jpeg" -F "Upload=Upload" url
By checking the output, I got the flag

PROTECTION
	Checking only the content-type is not efficient.
	You can list allowed extension
	You can validate the file type using a file type detector
	You can scan for malwares
	You can, if possible, save files on a db insead of the server
