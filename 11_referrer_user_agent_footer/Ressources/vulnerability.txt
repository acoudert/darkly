REFERRER USER AGENT

If you look at the source code, you can see a huge comment
By reading it, you find 2 interesting things:
	You must cumming from : "https://www.nsa.gov/" to go to the next step
	Let's use this browser : "ft_bornToSec". It will help you a lot.
Translation is, use https://www.nsa.gov/ as referrer and ft_bornToSec as user-agent
Let's do that with curl:
	curl -e "https://www.nsa.gov/" -A "ft_bornToSec" /?page=e43ad1fdc54babe674da7c7b8f0127bde61de3fbe01def7d00f151c2fcca6d1c | grep flag	

PROTECTION
	First thing first, let's remove it from the html comments
	Then, using a referrer and/or a user-agent to display sensitive information is not a good idea
	Better to use session token or token based authentication
