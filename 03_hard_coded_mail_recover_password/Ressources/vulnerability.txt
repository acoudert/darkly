Hard Coded Mail in HTML - Recover Password

The recover password submit form sends an email to webmaster@borntosec.com.
We can change this email address and get the password back to the email address we chose

PROTECTION
	First thing first the email should be handled by the back.
	Moreover, that would be a better idea to request the email address and to handle the password only for this email address instead of just a recover button open to the world.
