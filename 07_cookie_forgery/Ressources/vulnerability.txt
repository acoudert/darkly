Weak Encoding Cookie

If we give a look at our cookie. We find one like this:
	i_am_admin:68934a3e9455fa72420237eb05902327
Using crackstation, we can crack the value nd it gives us "false" (md5)
We can then hash "true" and put replace the i_am_admin cookie value with it:
	echo -n true | openssl md5

PROTECTION
	Provided cookie hash that can be broken so easily is a bad idea
	First thing first, md5 is broken and should no longer be used
	It's also better to use algorithm that compute slowly as it would make a btute force attck slower whether it is online or offline
	Using a better algorithm is a solution
	Still using authentification_token is quite better
