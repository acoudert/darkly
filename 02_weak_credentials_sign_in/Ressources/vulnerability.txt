Weak Credentials - Sign In

2 ways to exploit:
	1. SQL Injection results:
		Considering sql injection we made earlier. We found all users on their associated passwords.
			=> Trying admin:shadow gives you the flag
	
	2. Brute Force:
		We can bruteforce the password of admin with a tool like hydra if we are lazy but it is also easy to write a script doing it.
			Worlist used is "rockyou" which is a reference for dictionnary attack
			=> brute_force.py

PROTECTION
	To prevent a brute_force and/or dictionnary attack, you can pick up a stronger password, capital, digits, special characters etc.
		=> You can enforce your users to pick up strong password during the the password validation. This can be done in the front but it also needs to be done on the back as a user can use the front as he sees fit
	
Note:
	Let's not forget the username and password passed as plaintext in an HTTP querystring making this website highly vulnerable to MIM attack
