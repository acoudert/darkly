Persisting XSS

On this page we have to text input.
I tried injecting js code in the message part but it didn't work as it is sanitized.
Then I tried to do it in the name field. Unfortunately, we cannot inject a lot of characters. So I just modified the maxlength attribute to be able to put how much text as I wanted.
	I tried writing <h1>Hello</h1> => Displayed Hello in bulk
	I tried putting an alert script which didnt work
	I tried to escape the script sanitizing by inserting <button onclick="alert(1)">Click me</button> which worked
	I tried to see if we could get cookies and I used  <img src="image.gif" onerror="alert(document.cookie)"> which worked too
	Still no flag while those are critical flaws  
	abc</td><button onclick="window.location.href = \"http://www.w3schools.com\"">Click me</button><td>ab

I must say I got crazy on this one
All you need to do to get the flag is to write "script" in the message part
This is not a vulnerability, the one above is actually critical

PROTECTION
	Filter input through validation, tons of library can do it
	You can do this  from the fron and from the back
